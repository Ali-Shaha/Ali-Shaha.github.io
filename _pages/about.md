Hello! I’m **Ali Shahanaghi**, **CFD expert** in the Product Development team at [Elcogen Oy, Finland](https://elcogen.com/). My work focuses on using **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** and modeling techniques to optimize energy conversion in Green Hydrogen technologies.

Previously, I was an academic researcher at **Aalto University, Finland**, where I earned my **D.Sc.** degree. I also hold an **M.Sc.** from **Tarbiat Modares University** and a **B.Sc.** from **Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran**. My academic education is in **Mechanical Engineering (Energy Conversion)**, with a focus on **CFD**.

My research and professional expertise involves:

- **Computational Fluid Dynamics** for complex flows  
- **Compressible and multiphase flow modeling**  
- **Chemical reaction modeling and Electrochemistry**  
- **CFD-driven model development**

I am interested in applying **numerical modeling and simulation** to solve real-world engineering problems and advance energy technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new **CFD methods and modeling techniques**.
