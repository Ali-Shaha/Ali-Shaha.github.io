Hello! I’m **Ali Shahanaghi**, **CFD expert** in the Product Development team at [Elcogen Oy, Finland](https://elcogen.com/). My work focuses on using **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** and modeling techniques to optimize energy conversion in Green Hydrogen technologies.

Previously, I was an academic researcher at **Aalto University**, Finland, where I completed my D.Sc. degree. I also received my M.Sc. from **Tarbiat Modares University** and B.Sc. from **Amirkabir University of Technology**, Tehran, Iran. My academic education is in **Mechanical Engineering** (Energy Conversion), with a focus on **CFD**.

My research and professional expertise involves:

- **CFD** for complex flows  
- **Compressible** and **multiphase flow** modeling  
- **Chemical reaction modeling** and **Electrochemistry**  
- **CFD-driven model development**

I am interested in applying numerical models and simulation to solve real-world engineering problems and advance energy technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new CFD methods and modeling techniques.
