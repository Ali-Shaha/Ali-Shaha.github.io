 To explore knock through computational fluid dynamics, the adoption of advanced numerical methods is necessary. In this context, the current study introduces ARCFoam, a computational framework that combines dynamic mesh balancing, chemistry balancing, and adaptive mesh refinement with an explicit, density-based solver designed for simulating high-speed flows in OpenFOAM. First, the validity and performance of the solver are assessed . Second, the study explores the one/two-dimensional (1D/2D) hotspot ignition for the primary reference fuel and illuminates the impact of transitioning to 2D simulations on the predicted combustion modes.
