The effects of blending DMF and DME on the combustion of gasoline surrogate are numerically studied. The gasoline surrogate is toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) mixtures containing iso-octane, n-heptane, and toluene. Two skeletal mechanisms are proposed for the analysis: mechanism A with 504 species and 4212 reactions and mechanism B with 153 species and 740 reactions. These mechanisms are validated against a wide range of experimental data on ignition delay times and 1-D flames.
