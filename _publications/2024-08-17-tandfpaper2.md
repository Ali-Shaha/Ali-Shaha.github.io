End-gas auto-ignition leading to knocking combustion is one of the major barriers to achieving higher thermal efficiencies in downsized boosted spark-ignition engines. Using the established one-dimensional (1D) theoretical and computational framework, the effect of average temperature (including NTC range), initial pressure, and ethanol addition are investigated. Moreover, appearance of NTC chemistry-related events i.e. coolspots, secondary ignition kernels, and off-centered ignition are analyzed using 1D simulations.
