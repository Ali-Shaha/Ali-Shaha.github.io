DLBFoam, novel open-source library for OpenFOAM, accelerates reactive flow simulations by combining dynamic load balancing (DLB) and analytical Jacobian (via pyJac) methods, optimizing ODE solutions. The simulated tutorials show up to two orders of magnitude speed-up, enabling complex 3D combustion simulations (e.g. ECN Spray A, Sandia flame D). The tutorials are open-access."
