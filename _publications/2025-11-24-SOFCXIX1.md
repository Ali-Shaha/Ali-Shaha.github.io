Thermal and flow imbalance analysis in multistack configurations is numerically investigated. Such study resulted in design optimization for MW-class solid oxide fuel cell/electrolyzer systems. The CFD study involves conjugate heat transfer modeling in large-scale SOC modules to help performance and degradation mitigation strategies.
