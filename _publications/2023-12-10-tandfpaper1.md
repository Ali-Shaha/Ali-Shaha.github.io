## Abstract
An analytical and systematic method on the role of local thermal stratification on the combustion mode is provided as a-priori diagnostics tool to separate the deflagration and auto-ignition combustion modes by considering the diffusion effects, based on two parameters: stratification wavelength (λ) and amplitude (ΔT). The diagnostics tool is an extension of Zeldovich's theory to transient problems by solving the diffusion equation and considering the flame and ignition timescales.
